# Smart-Grader
Artificial Intelligence application to be implemented in educational institutions as a faster and easier way to grade free response questions (FRQs). 

## To Do
- [ ] Split up data into training, test, and cross validation sets
- [ ] Don't rely on accuracy of predictions against the training data as a metric for the accuracy of our model (could convey a false sense of generalization accuracy and mask overfitting)
- [ ] Make grading feature (use row matrices for inputted data and correct answers)
